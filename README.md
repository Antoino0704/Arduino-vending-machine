# Arduino-vending-machine
simulates a vending machine where the LEDs represent food 

# THE LED

red led --> 0.20€

yellow led --> 0.30€

green led --> 0.40€

blue led --> 0.50€

white led --> indicates how long it is to reach the price of that product according to the budget (example if you have € 0.10 and you want to buy the green led (€ 0.30) the white led flashes twice

# THE BUTTON

the various buttons are used to buy a certain food (therefore a LED) based on the position in which it coincides (for example the first button is used to buy the first LED and so on) both the numbering of the LEDs start from left to right

# Requirements

1 Arduino (recommend Arduino uno but you can use another model)

1 breadboard (but I used 2)

5 resistor

5 led (colors of your choice)

5 button

15 jumper (but I used 16)
